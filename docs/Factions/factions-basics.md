# Factions Basics
In this section you will:
- Learn how to create a faction
- Learn how to invite players to your faction
- Learn how to enemy, friend, and ally with other factions

## Getting Started

When joining the server for the first time, you can either join an existing faction or create your own.

Joining a faction involves fewer steps, as you just need to use the join command, so let's go your own way.

## Make Your Faction

Time to make your own new faction! The create command lets you set the faction's name:

`/f create koolkids`

Awesome! Now koolkids is a real faction and you're its leader! Let's give it a good description:

`/f desc Where all the kool kids hang out`

Very intimidating! Time to really intimidate with a quality base. Find a good looking chunk and claim it.

`/f claim`

You are now the proud owner of a chunk! Build yourself a little house, maybe put a bed inside, and set faction home.

`/f sethome`

Now, your faction members can teleport to this location to go back to the base. Wait! You need members!

`/f invite jeb_`

If he so chooses, jeb_ can now `/f join koolkids` and be a part of your faction!

## Grow Your Faction

Your faction will need money to expand and grow it's influence! Start by depositing some money into your faction bank:

`/f money deposit [amount]`

In the future, you can check your balance using the faction balance command:

`/f money balance`

If you want to withdrawl money from your faction bank you can use the faction withdrawl command:

`/f money withdrawl [amount]`

:::tip
While any faction member can deposit into the faction bank, only members with certain permissions can withdrawl. Your faction owner can configure who can do this.

Next, lets expand your faction! To claim a new chunk for your faction, stand in the chunk you want to claim and run: 

`/f claim`
