# RTP Basics
The RackMC Lands server has an RTP (random teleport) plugin to make it easier to get away from spawn or find new locations. You can use it at any time by simply doing `/rtp`

# RTP Limitations
While beneficial for exploring, RTP does have a few limitations.
1. RTP will take you at least 500 blocks away from spawn, but will only go out 5000 blocks in any direction. Chunks are loaded out to this point, so the experience will be lag free.
2. RTP has a 5 minute cooldown in order to prevent players from relying too much on it for exploring.
