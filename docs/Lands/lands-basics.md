# Lands Basics
In this section you will learn how the RackMC Lands server works! 

## Creating a Land
It's time to create your first settlement! To start, use the create command:

`/lands create <name>`



Next, you will want to enter the selection mode using the selection command:

`/lands selection` 

or use the selection tool, if provided by the server.

Select both corners of the area you want to claim

Use left and right click to do so.



Finally you will want to claim the area you have selected using the claim command:

`/lands claim`

If no selection made, it will claim the chunk you're standing on.

If no land has been created before, it will automatically create a land with your name.



Open the lands menu to manage your land

`/lands menu`
