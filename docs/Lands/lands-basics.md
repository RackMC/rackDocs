# Lands Basics
In this section you will learn how the RackMC Lands server works! 

## Creating a Land
It's time to create your first settlement! To start, use the create command:

`/lands create <name>`

Next, you will want to select the area for your land. To do this, you will select two corners using the selection command:

`/lands selection` 

Finally you will want to claim the area you have selected using the claim command:

`/lands claim`

:::note 
If no selection made, it will claim the chunk you're standing on. 
If no land has been created before, it will automatically create a land with your name. 
:::

For a simple way to edit your new land, you can use `/lands menu`
