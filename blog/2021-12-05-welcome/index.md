Welcome to RackMC

This is our offical website. Here is where we host our documentation and tutorials for our various servers, as well as changelogs and blog posts.

RackMC is a Minecraft Server Network dedicated to providing ALL players with a COMPLETE and FULL experience. As of December fifth the network is currently under construction.

You can find our documentation for all the different server types [here](/docs/index), and our blogposts/changelogs on the sidebar.
