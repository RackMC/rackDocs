Hello all!

Despite the lack of communication over the past few months, we have some good news! We plan to start working on RackMC once again. 

All four of us on the admin team are currently in college and our time over these couple of months has been focused on that. It may have seemed like we had given up, especially after promising an early 2022 launch, but we are far from it. We are all still super passionate for this project and want to see it succeed. Especially with all the time and effort we have put in, we don't want to see it end like this. 

As of right now, we still all have our focus elsewhere, but I just want to let you all know that RackMC is not out of mind. We are slowly starting to get back into things and get some work done. We don't have any estimate of when the server will be ready and we don't plan on having one until everything is finished. Until then, expect more events and other things in the coming weeks.
