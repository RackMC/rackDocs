Hello Everyone,

For those of you that do not already know, a security vulnerability within Minecraft was recently discovered. The vulnerability stems from an exploit within Log4j, a common java library. Mojang has already released a patch for clients, so you should not be at any risk when joining servers. All you have to do to install the patch is launch Minecraft from the official launcher. If you use external clients, make sure to check with them before joining any servers. They will likely have a message posted on their website. Here is a link to a Mojang article if you would like to read more: https://bit.ly/3ydImi5

NOTE: We have patched our servers, so none of this should be an issue when playing on RackMC. However, it is best practice to make sure that your clients have also been patched.
